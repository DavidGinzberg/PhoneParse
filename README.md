# PhoneParser

An exercise in extracting phone numbers from text using regular expressions.

## Instructions

**NOTE:** *Do not dial these phone numbers, they are random and may be actual
numbers of people who don't want random calls.*

1. After loading into IntelliJ IDEA, run the program to confirm it is
 functioning and you can see the document text printed out.
 
2. Generate a regular expression and use it to find three (3) dash-formatted US
 telephone numbers (`xxx-xxx-xxxx`).
 
3. Next, try to find all US-style phone numbers. The numbers may be separated
 by dashes, periods, parenthesis, spaces, or not at all

4. Finally, try to build a regex that will match any of the above numbers, as
 well as all of the international numbers (preceded by a plus `+` and a country
 code) in the document. Count the total number of phone numbers you've found.
